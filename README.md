# 🎓 DED Learning Session — Public Showcase

A **public, educational showcase** of the core ideas behind **Decentralized Education Development (DED)**:

- On-chain **learning session artifacts** (videos, comments, etc.)
- Simple **threaded discussions** using parent/child relationships
- Lightweight **voting & reputation** for evaluating learning outcomes

> ⚠️ This repo is intentionally simplified and **omits production logic, economics, and advanced arbitration mechanisms**.  
> It is meant as a **conceptual & technical demo**, not the full DED protocol.

## 🌐 High-Level Idea

DED explores how to represent **learning sessions** and their outputs as **on-chain artifacts**:

- A **Student** completes a learning session and uploads an artifact (usually a video, or a reference to one).
- **Comments** can be attached to that artifact in a tree/thread structure.
- **Arbitrators / peers** can vote on artifacts to signal whether the learning goals were met.
- A simple **reputation score** is derived from votes across artifacts.

This repo shows a **minimal smart contract** expressing those ideas in Solidity, without revealing deeper protocol mechanics.

## 🧱 Core Solidity Contract

The core contract in this showcase:

- Stores **artifacts** (videos, comments) with:
  - `id`
  - `parentId`
  - `author`
  - `createdAtBlock`
  - `type` (VIDEO or COMMENT)
  - `CID` (content identifier for off-chain content, e.g. IPFS/Filecoin)
- Allows users to:
  - Create artifacts (`createArtifact`)
  - Read artifacts (`getArtifact`)
- Allows voters to:
  - Vote +1 / -1 / 0 on artifacts (`vote`)
  - Query aggregated scores for an artifact (`getArtifactScore`)
  - Query author reputation across their artifacts (`getAuthorReputation`)

All content payloads (video, text, etc.) are expected to be stored **off-chain** (e.g. IPFS, Filecoin, Web3.Storage) and referenced via the `CID` string.

## 🧩 Contract: `LearningSession.sol`

Key features:

- Simple **enum** for artifact type (VIDEO, COMMENT).
- `Artifact` struct with parent/child linking for threading.
- Vote tracking per `(artifactId, voter)` using a `bytes32` voterId abstraction.
- No token economics, no payouts, no access control beyond basic checks.

📄 See [`src/LearningSession.sol`](./src/LearningSession.sol) for full details.
